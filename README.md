**Magistar AI Image Generator**

**Description of the project**

This is a simple AI Image generator developed with a MERN Stack and a Dalle-3 API from OpenAI. The project was inspired by the desire to create images of things for easy understanding and comprehension. As they say in design “If you can see it someone can create it”, hence the inspiration to create this app so that imaginary and visionary individuals can use their imagination to create images as per their imaginations
